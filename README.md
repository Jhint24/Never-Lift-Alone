## Results

By Utilizing a geocoding APi provided by Google we were able to use a user input to save their location information on our servers.  Using that data we pulled information from the google places API to display a map of gyms or parks, or pools, depending on what type of workout they are looking to do.  Then used all of that information to sort and display other users who are looking for an exercise partner based on location and workout type.  This domain is now owned by us and the site is fully hosted.
